![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6a1cfbf-9e61-4e96-885b-e895076fa83d)

## Important information

* Presentation date: `19 April`

## Guidelines

We've been developing experiments that help to demonstrate the possibility and worthiness of exploring a given
application or topic. This presention should outline the various areas of inspiration, motivation, and method
behind your current independent applied project or research. Your goal is _not_ to demonstrate your project; instead
you should describe:

* area(s) explored, with emphasis on "dead ends" or failed ideas
* the relevance and significance of your current, hopefully more successful, line of research
* an experiment which explores a specific aspect of the research area you've arrived at
* how this experiment will demonstrate, confirm, or refute some aspect of your topic
* progress made in implementing your project which may include
  * technologies implemented
  * programs or other computational artifacts built or underway
  * your understanding of what "success" will look like

## Slides

You are limited no more that `7` slides with a total of `25` words across the _entire presentation_, focusing
on ways that you can communicate your project simply, visually, and orally.

## Presentation log

See course [evaluation and deliverable guidelines for these posts](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-580-spring-2025/course-materials/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#presentation-log) for more information vis-a-vis requirements.

This post should include:

* a link to the Github repository described in the presentation
* an assessment of your presentation, considering:
  * your use of narrative to tell an overall story behind your process
  * your use of audience engagement skills to _create_ a presentation, rather than merely _deliver_ one
  * an appraisal of your slide construction, its relative effectiveness, and its impact on the presentation

To be clear with your responses to each of the areas above, the instructor encourages you to use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/markdown-cheatsheet) headings to create sections.

Each student is also required to upload their own copy of the presentation to their `Presentation Log`, linking it in the post. See the
sample post included in your `Project Portfolio` for details.
