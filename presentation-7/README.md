## Important information

* Presentation date: `17 March`

## Guidelines

Returning to the experiments we wrapped up before break, this presentation asks you to take into account
our brief presentation exercise from last week. For this presentation, attempt to present the results or 
implications of your `Disciplinary Research` experiment in such a way that a non-specialist audience
would find the topic interesting and compelling. Clearly, less fireworks than the presentations from
`10 March`, but many of the same principles you learned by doing our `Powerpoint Karaoke` activity apply.

## Slides

You are limited no more that `7` slides with a total of `25` words across the _entire presentation_. Of course,
words that label figures or diagrams don't count, but _don't make a figure of just words and call it a figure
or a chart_.

These presentations should:

* appeal to a non-specialist audience that knows _nothing_ about your topic
* stage the narrative of the experiment as a journey of knowledge discovery
* _show_ rather than _tell_ us the outcomes and implications of your work
* end with a clear "next steps" which frames the knowledge discovered as a launching point for future knowledge

## Presentation log

See course [evaluation and deliverable guidelines for these posts](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-580-spring-2025/course-materials/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#presentation-log) for more information vis-a-vis requirements.

This post should include:

* Summary of the overall narrative that you developed for this presentation and its relationship to the slides
* A brief discussion of the slide composition of your presentation and the role of the "slide" functions in this presentation
* An appraisal of how successful you feel like you were in making this presentation focusing on presenter skills related to:
  * audience engagement
  * presentation variety (vocal, body language, ways to presenting data)
  * presentation confidence (how did you (or could you?) show it?)

To be clear with your responses to each of the areas above, the instructor encourages you to use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/markdown-cheatsheet) headings to create sections.

Each student is also required to upload their own copy of the presentation to their `Presentation Log`, linking it in the post. See the
sample post included in your `Project Portfolio` for details.
