## Important information

* Presentation date: `10 March`

## Guidelines

The purpose of this presentation is to cultivate presentation skills centered on audience engagement
and narrative rather than merely technical detail. In this presentation, you will be assigned to groups
in which you will give a presentation that you've never seen before. Your team will have 5 minutes to
review and collaborate on a common slide narrative.

This post should include:

* Summary of the overall narrative that you developed for this presentation and its relationship to the slides

* An appraisal of how successful you feel like you were in making this presentation focusing on presenter skills related to:
  * audience engagement
  * presentation variety (vocal, body language, ways to presenting data)
  * presentation confidence (how did you (or could you?) show it?)

To be clear with your responses to each of the areas above, the instructor encourages you to use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/markdown-cheatsheet) headings to create sections.
Each student is also required to upload their own copy of the presentation to their `Presentation Log`, linking it in the post. See the
